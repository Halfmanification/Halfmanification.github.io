            <h1>Baby steps</h1>
            <h4><i>22-01-2025</i></h4>
            <p>I've been trying to start game development for quite some time now, with project after project being
                started
                on
                with great gusto and eagerness, just for that motivation to be blown away after a few days/weeks
                because a combination of lack of experience in game design, not familiar enough with the tools at hand,
                and
                most
                of all the deep pit of scope creep.
            </p>

            <p>As a senior software developer and avid video game enjoyer, I figured I could pick up game development
                without meeting too many hurdles, at least on the technical side of things. I expected the biggest
                issues I
                would have was on the art and audio side of things, but as failed project after failed
                project has shown, I was living a lie. I probably have about 20 unfinished Godot projects a handful of
                Unity
                projects, at least 3 c++/OpenGLprojects, and more non-game C# projects than I can count gathering dust
                in
                the bowels of my computer. Forget not finishing first, I apparently don't finish at all.
            </p>

            <p>In my professional life I do mostly back-end .Net development for clients large and small, with some
                infrastructure and operations work on the side. It's full on enterprise most of the time, with all
                that follows that good and bad. I often end up in a position of cleaning technical debt, creating
                standards,
                building in-house tools and libraries, making frameworks, and generally working towards the
                impossible: "The perfect code". It never ends up perfect, but I get to pretend while I work that it will
                end
                up
                that way. This approach to development is working fine in the environments I frolic in
                between 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, but when that same brain tried to take up personal projects the
                house
                of
                card crumbles. The result? Fields of dust bunnies.
            </p>

            <p>What I am getting at here is that I always end up either out of scope, or so far outside my knowledge
                that I
                don't even know how to progress and end up scrapping or abandoning almost all my
                personal projects. For the games I've tried building, I always set myself up for failure by going after
                a
                game
                design for a game I want to play. Why do I do this? Well it's the most common answer
                to "how do I get started with game development?". The philosophy is as follows:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>"Just make the game you would want to play. Just start building it, and just build it one step at a
                    time."</i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That might work for many, but not for me. I simply cannot build the games I want to play, because the
                games I
                want play are too complex for me to give a reasonable scope,
                build and at the same time learn the tools I'm using (this might be skill issues, but it's my reality
                regardless). I often end up down the wrong rabbit hole implementing something
                using the wrong tools in the wrong way. My progress grinds to a halt, and I have dug so much of this
                rabbit
                hole
                that turning back seems almost inconceivable. Of course I recognize
                this as the classic sunk cost fallacy, and in a professional setting I usually deal just fine with this,
                but
                when it's just myself that holds me responsible and I have no meaningful
                deadlines, the get out clause "Meh, this project isn't fun anymore, let's do something else fun instead"
                is
                readily at hand.
            </p>

            <p>Then I found the <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 games challenge</a>. This
                was a
                totally different approach than what I had been trying so far,
                simply ignore what I would want to play, and focus on using
                predefined, curated game designs to learn the tools and strategies I need to build my own games one day.
                To
                add
                to the arsenal of aids that could keep my projects in check
                scope-vise I also decided to force myself to use a well defined backlog and task board, and write
                individual
                tasks for everything I needed to do. Whenever a feature or task
                became overwhelming, I would try to split it into multiple more manageable tasks (I know, revolutionary
                thinking
                right here). I'd been hesitant to do this before, as I was
                afraid it would feel too close to work, but since my previous approaches didn't work out I might as well
                give it
                a go.
            </p>

            <p>And it worked! Somewhat at least. The first game on the list is the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic Pong</a>,
                originally released in 1972 by Atari for arcades, and probably one of the most cloned games ever.
            </p>

            <p>Development started great, and I was very diligent with writing and completing tasks with a well defined
                and
                small scope. It allowed me to leave the computer after
                each development session feeling that I wasn't in the middle of something, and almost made it so
                motivation
                wasn't even a factor any more. Sitting down and picking
                up a task was very easy. An example of how small a task could be was "Record a simple sound for when the
                ball
                hits something". Beautifully simple and easy to do;
                I just ran around the house with my phone recording stuff hitting other stuff until I found a sound I
                liked,
                dragged the sound file into Audacity, learned JUST
                enough to understand how to cut down the soundbite to just what I needed, and exported it.
            </p>

            <p>Then when I was about 98% done (or 80% as I thought at the time) with the game, I fell back into my old
                habits,
                and everything immediately ground to a halt. I got it in
                my head that I wanted to add a settings menu, accessible from both the main menu and the pause menu.
                Buttons were added, but even before I got to designing the Settings menu itself, I stupidly said to
                myself;
                "With all of these menus, and now with one menu being access from two different parts of the game,
                surely this needs to be centralized into a MenuManager of some kind. And while I'm at it, all of these
                menus
                share quite of lot of base functionality, like being opened, closed, and possibly having a previous menu
                it should go back to when closed. Let's create a base class just called 'Menu', and have all the menus
                inherit
                from this."
            </p>

            <p>I know.</p>

            <p>Trust me, I know.</p>

            <p>Keep it simple, stupid.</p>

            <p>Because of this relatively simple, intrusive thought, I ground this simple Pong project to a halt for
                over a
                week. I quickly overcomplicated everything, made changes in large parts of the game
                files, and once again felt the boredom and frustration creep in. The last 6 days I didn't
                even open Godot. The dust started gathering.
            </p>

            <p>Then today, literally the same day as I'm writing this, I finished my game, published it, and wrote this
                little retrospective article. How? The algorithms recommended this <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jgTCayWlwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazing video</a>
                from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bps.shorts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BPS.shorts YouTube channel</a> about personal
                engineering
                projects. I urge you to watch this, especially if you are stuck with any project. The main points I took
                away from
                this was a lesson in scope and scope creep, knowing what is worth investing time in, where to take
                shortcuts
                or
                even cut out features completely, and what really matters. What really matters most of the time, and
                what
                was the
                point of this whole exercise of the <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 games
                    challenge</a>
                was for me to COMPLETE PROJECTS.
            </p>

            <p>So in the span of about 2 hours, I reverted ALL of the current changes I had since my last commit to git,
                deleted 3 tasks (settings menu, menu management, and player controller scheme selection). I opened 3 new
                tasks:
            </p>

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove settings buttons from all menus.</li>
                <li>Hard code player control schemes, only allowing keyboard controls</li>
                <li>Publish game in itch.io</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>It's 21:44, about 3 hours after I reverted my changes and deleted the old tasks. I only added one more
                task
                at
                the end: "Write a dev-log". The game is published, and playable both single and multiplayer
                in the browser, and I'm reaching the end of this article. I did it. I finished my project. It is
                possible.
