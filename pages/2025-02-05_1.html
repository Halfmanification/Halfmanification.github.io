            <p>
                It has been 13 days since I finished the previous game <a href="https://halfmanification.itch.io/pong"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pong</a>,
                and my progress through the <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">20 games challenge</a>
                marches on, this time with finishing up Flappybird. As my <a
                    href="https://github.com/Halfmanification/20gameschallenge_2_flappy-bird/commits/main/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git history</a>
                shows, work on this has been sporadic at best, but I feel I got a lot less stuck this time around than
                when developing Pong.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to compare these two games I find it interesting that they are ranked as the same difficulty
                level in terms of
                development in the 20 games challenge, at least in my experience, Pong was a technically harder game to
                implement. The
                main part here is the multiple player controls, and the AI when playing single player. Flappybird on the
                other hand has
                a single input, the 'Flap' action, and requires no AI, is just single player and has no win-condition to
                keep track of.
                I guess the challenge in this game was that it has a lot more art than Pong has. In total I drew about
                7-8 sprites and
                backgrounds for this game using a combination of <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Aseprite</a> and <a href="https://www.photopea.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Photopea</a>, an activity I don't have much
                natural (or trained) talent in, but that I find relaxing and possible to do while listening to an audio
                book or watching a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the development of Pong I reflected a bit about a time where I got stuck trying to 'enterprisify'
                the menu system
                for the game, and how I eventually got out of that. This time I had much less trouble with this
                occurring, I managed keep
                my cool and for the most part say that "if it works, it's done" and go on to the next task. Yes I had to
                rebuild a couple
                of things down the line, but in this small of a project it wasn't too bad. And leveraging Godot's signal
                system, things
                are naturally quite loosely coupled, so that also helps with refactoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the main lesson taken away from this project is a reminder that making things "good enough" is
                ok, and that
                spending a day just drawing was quite a nice activity to do in the middle of development, giving a break
                from the technical
                side of things.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, I think finishing this game proves to me that I AM able to finish projects, and that the
                game development dream still isn't dead.
