            <h1>Professional vs Personal projects, FIGHT!</h1>
            <h4><i>18-02-2025</i></h4>
            <p>I have been primarily working from home since early 2020 (guess why), and have at this point definetively built my day to day life, living situation, hobbies and personal finances around the fact that I don't have to travel for work. Of course I'm fully aware of the privileged situation that is, and at the same time I now feel in a position where I can very easilly argue that this is how I expect to continue working for the forseeable future, at least as long as my responsibilities at work remain of the same technical nature. But every now and then a situation crops up where even I find it natural to go back to the office; Switching projects and teams, swithing employer, onboarding trainees, large scale workshops, etc, and the last month has been one of these periods.</p>

<p>This is natural. I might not like it, I might even complain (at least in private), but I understand that under certain circumstances it makes more sense to work in the same physical location as my coworkers, so I travel. I have many thoughts on work from home that I will spare for another blog post, as those are not the primary topic this time.</p>

<p>All that is to say that for me, traveling to the office costs me about 1,5 hours one way, 3 hours in total for a single visit to the office. And that if is traffic is normal and the public transport is reliable. That is 15 hours per week, 60 hours per month. But let's be real, I don't go everyday. This last month I have been in between 3-4 days per week, so lets round that down to 40-45 hours over the last month I have been traveling</p>

<p>This has a cost. An economic one yes, but in this case I'm talking about a psychological cost in terms of my energy to work on my personal projects outside of work. Not just programming, but everything that is not work such as chores, house maintenance, socialising (even with my partners at home), and taking care of my physical and mental health. Where I would usually get some personal stuff done before work in the morning, I now have to get up even earlier to beat the traffic, and I still get home later (and thus mentally end work) later than I would when I work from home. I'm also not the most social butterfly in the world, so I'm also getting quite drained from just meeting a lot of people and traveling on overcrowded public transport. In short, the biggest cost this has is my energy for my life outside work in all aspects.</p>

<p>The effect of this has been delayed, as you can probably tell from my previous blog posts, I kept up quite well with the game development hobby during the end of January, but after about 2,5 weeks I hit a wall, and the first thing that stopped was that hobby. I would get up tired, come home tired, force myself to make dinner, and generally end up just gaming while watching youtube the rest of the day. We have very open communication at home, so no one was supprised when I started to dissapear into the entertainment hole with noise cancelling headphones on from the moment I came home from work.</p>

<p>Now that month has passed, but I expect an equally long delay to regain my energy again before I'm back to normal. I also haven't really had any energy to write any blog posts for the past week or so, but forced myself today as I thought it important and/or interesting to capture this experience and feelings as fresh as possible, and I might write another post as a little retrospective to this in a months time.</p>

<p>The next game up in the 20 games challenge is Breakout, but I'm going to make an active choice to wait until the weekend before I start developing it, there is absolutely no point in trying to guilt myself into doing it with my current energy levels, that will only result in guilt and frustration over low productivity, and probably an even longer restitution time before I'm back to normal.</p>

<p>So take care, value your time and energy, and I'll do the same</p>
