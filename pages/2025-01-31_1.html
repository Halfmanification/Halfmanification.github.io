Temp notes:
<ul>
<li>Started flappy bird a few days ago (check git)</li>
<li>very simple compared to pong(multiplayer, ai, bouncing ball etc)</li>
<li>core game was finished in no time</li>
<li>now semi-stuck mentally because I don't have anymore of the gameplay left to build, only polish in adding art, sound, menus etc. <li>Have to force myself to finish those tasks even though I want to go on to the next game, because the whole point is finishing projects.</li>
<li>I know I will enjoy having all those features implemented, but the process of adding them is not as fun as building gameplay.</li>
</ul>
(Refine tomorrow)
