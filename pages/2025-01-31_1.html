Temp notes:

- Started flappy bird a few days ago (check git)
- very simple compared to pong(multiplayer, ai, bouncing ball etc)
- core game was finished in no time
- now semi-stuck mentally because I don't have anymore of the gameplay left to build, only polish in adding art, sound, menus etc. 
- Have to force myself to finish those tasks even though I want to go on to the next game, because the whole point is finishing projects.
- I know I will enjoy having all those features implemented, but the process of adding them is not as fun as building gameplay.

(Refine tomorrow)
