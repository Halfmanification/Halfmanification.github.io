            <h1>Flapping forward, hitting pipes along the way</h1>
            <h4><i>02-02-2025</i></h4>

            <p>So its been about 10 days since I <a href="./2025-01-24_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last wrote about</a> the 20 games
                challenge.
                I've only been able to work on Flappy Birds sporadically since then,
                doing small bursts of development here and there. Here is a brief overview of what has been done so far:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>24-01-2025: Set up project, repository and wrote some tasks.</li>
                <li>28-01-2025: Set up the main game scene, and added the bird.</li>
                <li>29-01-2025: Added pipes that moved accross the screen, and spawned at randomly within a height
                    range.
                </li>
                <li>31-01-2025: Added a score counter and refined the code behind collision handling.</li>
                <li>02-02-2025: Added all remaining art for the main game scene.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I noticed an interesting behaviour in my self during these development sessions, where I found it quite
                easy
                to
                find motivation up until I had implemented the core game mechanics. Making the bird flap,
                the pipes move, score being counted, and collisions handled correctly was something I was motivated to
                sit
                down
                and do. But when I ended the development session on the 31st of January, I suddenly felt
                a slight dread to continue. I shrugged this off in the moment, but when I got up the next day I felt it
                even
                stronger. The game was in some respects finished, "only" missing all the correct art, sound,
                and menus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aka, most of the game in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                My impulses screamed that it would be a lot more fun to go on to the next game immediately at this
                point.
                Who
                cared if the menus, sound and art wasn't done? It wasn't like I was going to sell this game
                to anyone, so that stuff would just be "fluff" to the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I refused, and while out on a quick drive to the nearby grocery store I had a little introspective
                moment
                where I dug into these feelings. Why was it always this way? The programming part of any development
                project is always the easiest for me to do, but all the other aspects of a game (or any software) I find
                myself
                shy away from. I'm no artist, and no sound engineer/musician, but I know I'm capable of producing
                something passable, at least for a small project like this. I'm not sure I have a concrete answer yet,
                but
                if I
                were to guess it has to do partially with stepping outside my comfort zone, producing a less
                than perfect result (weird that don't feel this about code), or simply the fear of doing things I find
                somewhat
                'boring' in my personal time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stupid thing is that as soon as I start doing any of these non-code tasks, I usually find them a lot
                more
                engaging than I initially thought they would be. Sitting with Aseprite open and just doodling
                while listening to Spotify, or digging through sound bites and music for a fitting sound scape is
                actually
                quite
                enjoyable. And when the art, menus, and sound is in place, the game feels so much more
                alive than before. I had the same experience with creating Pong, where the moment I had some sound and
                music
                in
                the game I found myself starting it to test, but ending up just playing for fun for 3-4 minutes.
                So it has to be 'starting' the tasks that I dread. Being in a workflow is easy, but starting work and
                getting
                into a flow is hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                So today I did exactly that. I fired up Aseprite and just threw a black line on the screen. No rime or
                reason to
                the line, but it was just to draw something as opposed to staring on a blank canvas. And it worked!
                The black line didn't remain for long, but it served as a kick in my mental behind to get on with
                drawing
                the
                art, and in not more than an hour I had some simple, but quite nice art for the bird, pipes, ground,
                sky, and the components of a parallaxing background. These were all very quick to add into the game,
                simply
                by
                adding some TextureRects in Godot, and suddenly the game felt 100 times more like a proper game.
                The final little thing I did today was building a custom shader to create the parallaxing background.
                And
                before
                anyone have time to think "Wow, custom shaders, sounds fancy", this is the shader program in question,
                and yes, I had to google how to do this:
            </p>
            <pre class="code-block">
<code>shader_type canvas_item;

uniform float scroll_speed;

void vertex() {
    UV.x += TIME * scroll_speed;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                So I'm once again beating the drum about just starting and doing something, because once the inertia of
                moving
                have you traveling in a direction, there is no knowing how far you will go.
